# Artemis Financial - Secure Software Enhancement Project

## Overview
**Client:** *Artemis Financial*  
Artemis Financial needed enhanced software security to protect sensitive financial data. I addressed vulnerabilities by implementing **SHA-256 encryption**, improving **RESTful services**, and recommending **secure development practices**.

## Highlights
- Strengthened encryption using SHA-256.
- Improved API security with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.
- Recommended regular automated dependency scans.
- Emphasized secure coding to protect company assets and client information.

## Challenges and Solutions
Handling **certificate trust issues** during secure communications testing was challenging. To increase security layers, I managed dependencies carefully and ensured secure communication protocols.

## Testing and Validation
Post-refactoring, I:
- Verified endpoint functionality.
- Tested hashing outputs.
- Reviewed dependencies to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

## Takeaways
This project showcases my ability to identify vulnerabilities, refactor securely, and apply best practices â€” skills I would present to future employers.
